Version History  
===============  

## v1.0.0 
* Moved the Jaide GUI into its own repo, separate from [Jaide](http://github.com/NetworkAutomation/jaide).
	* This was felt to be necessary so that development and change tracking for each part of the Jaide project can be kept separate. It also allows our documentation to be split, so that users can more easily find docs for the specific tool they are using.
* Bring Jaide GUI up to compatibility with Jaide v2.0.0. 
	* This includes the new capabilites and features available in [Jaide 2.0.0](https://github.com/NetworkAutomation/jaide/releases/tag/v2.0.0)
