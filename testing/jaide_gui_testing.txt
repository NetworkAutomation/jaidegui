# GUI specific tests, tested in both windows and mac compiled versions:

# Setting defaults (and ensuring they load)
# save a template
# load a template
# toggle options
# clear output
# save output
# keyboard shortcuts
# switching to and from each of the options, to ensure there aren't any weird visual artefacts

# General usage should also be tested for different types of commands, writing output to one file vs many files, etc.
